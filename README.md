# ChatGPT-moment
What is ChatGPT? Think of it as a chatbot that can engage with you like a helpful assistant. So what does it know? It's even qualified to help you during the conversation! Basically it has billions of neurons or weights that allow it to "remember" lots of text from the Internet, or more specifically, learn the representation of the process that generate the text. Consequently, ChatGPT is a low-resolution version of human Internet world, and the human Internet world, in a sense, is the projection of our real world. In other words, ChatGPT learns a compressed, abstract and useable representation of our civilization. This is why ChatGPT exhibits a degree of humanity, even though it's primarily a next-word predictor driven by a LLM under the hood.

This repository aims to chronicle the AI evolution in ChatGPT moment. Since its inception, numerous apps based on it or its concept of large models have emerged overnight. I will try my best to track all trunk and branch of ChatGPT. But omissions and errors will definitely happen. I am happy to hear your suggestions!
